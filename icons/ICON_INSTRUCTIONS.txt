App Icons for PWA
==================

To complete the PWA setup, you need two icon files:

Required Icons:
- icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

OPTION 1: Create Custom Icons
-------------------------------
Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, Figma) to create:
1. A 512x512 PNG image with your app logo/design
2. A 192x192 PNG version of the same design
3. Save them in this directory

Design Tips:
- Use simple, recognizable imagery
- High contrast works best
- Consider a package/box icon for inventory theme
- Ensure the icon looks good at small sizes

OPTION 2: Use Placeholder Icons
--------------------------------
For quick testing, you can use simple placeholder icons.
Download free icons from:
- https://iconscout.com/
- https://www.flaticon.com/
- https://icons8.com/

Search for: "box", "package", "inventory", "warehouse"

OPTION 3: Generate Online
--------------------------
Use an online PWA icon generator:

- Upload a base image and it will generate all sizes

Icon Requirements:
- Format: PNG
- Background: Solid color or transparent
- Safe area: Keep important content in center 80%

After adding icons, the app can be installed to mobile home screen!
